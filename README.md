# Grader for Mashov

Unofficial version for "משוב" by Dolev Franco

The version offers an innovative and accessible design for "משוב" with almost all Mashov features plus useful features like: average of the scores, graphs, dark mode, more accessible functions like homework etc.

Average Competition: Students from all over the country compete together for who has the highest average! By class, school and all together. Sign up and see where you are together with your friends in the country.

The app has been created by a research project. The research project is about reverse engineering "משוב" app ([seee here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mashov.main)) and by branching out the traffic of "משוב" website ([see here](https://web.mashov.info/students/login)).
